             <h3>BUSINESS HISTORY</h3>
               <p>
                  The KDS Hardware Store was founded in 2016 by Dulliva, Kerine and Dahnia Simon.</br>
                  The hardware is located in rural Winnipeg and was developed as a means to make hardware
                  and building products readily available to individuals living outside the city. The business
                  started out very small but due to support from the community, it has expanded and hired 
                  five (5) employees.
